# 3-Tier-Web-API
Developed a RESTful web API using ASP.NET framework with a 3-tier architecture, following best practices for code maintainability and scalability. Implemented dependency injection and repository pattern to ensure loose coupling and separation of concerns, resulting in a highly modular and extensible codebase. Utilized Entity Framework for data access and implemented CRUD operations on a one-to-many relationship. Leveraged Swagger UI to provide interactive API documentation and testing capabilities. Additionally, developed a WinForms application and HTML page to test the API's functionality. Successfully delivered the project on time and within budget, resulting in positive feedback from stakeholders
